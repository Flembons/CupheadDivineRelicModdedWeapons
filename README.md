# Divine Relic with Modded Weapons

The Divine Relic charm makes it so your weapon is randomly changed every time you fire, but it normally can only pick from the 9 default weapons. This mod makes it so the relic also includes any custom weapons you have installed using the Blender API.

NOTE: You'll need to have another custom weapon mod installed for this to change anything. Installing this mod by itself will not change how the Divine Relic works.

Extract the zip in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cuphead (or wherever you have Cuphead installed)

How to Use
